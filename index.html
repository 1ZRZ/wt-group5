							<h3>The importance and necessity of environmental protection</h3>
							<p>The importance and necessity of environmental protection cannot be ignored. First of all, a healthy environment is the basis for maintaining biodiversity. Diverse ecosystems not only provide essential food, air and water for humans, but also support drug discovery and natural disaster mitigation. Secondly, good environmental quality is directly related to human health. Problems such as air and water pollution have been shown to cause a range of health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, environmental protection is essential for sustainable economic development. Effective management and use of natural resources can ensure their long-term availability and help prevent economic crises associated with resource depletion. Finally, in the face of global climate change, environmental protection can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat the adverse effects of climate change, and protect our shared planet. In short, from protecting natural resources, safeguarding public health, to promoting sustainable economic development, the importance of environmental protection is self-evident, and it is everyone's common responsibility and necessary action..</p>
